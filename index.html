    <br>$140. This may not be the cheapest point-and-shoot camera because you can get much better than the
    <br>cheapest for only a bit of extra money and that bit of extra money can go toward this camera. <br>

  the α6000 is actually older than the α5100 because the α6000 and the α5000 both
  <br>came out in the same year and the α5100 is a updated version of the α5000.</p> <br><br>
